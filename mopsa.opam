  "MOPSA: A Modular and Open Platform for Static Analysis using Abstract Interpretation"
description: """
MOPSA is a generic framework for building sound static analyzers based on Abstract Interpretation.
It features a modular architecture to support different kinds of languages, iterators, and abstract domains.
For the moment, MOPSA can analyze programs written in a subset of C and Python.
It reports run-time errors on C programs and uncaught exceptions on Python programs."""
