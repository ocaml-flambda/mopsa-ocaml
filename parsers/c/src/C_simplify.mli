  C_simplify - C AST to C AST simplification

  We optionnal apply a set of transformations to remove some constuctions
  and replace them with simpler ones. 
  One application is to ensure that each expression has at most one 
  side-effect (a call or an assignment).

  Note: these transormations make hepotheses on the order of evaluation of
  side-effects in expression.
  TODO: use a represantation that is more neutral to evaluation order
  (a partial order?)
