Python Benchmarks
=================

In addition to the files available in benchmarks/python/, there are two additional repositories containing benchmarks we use on Mopsa:

- the `pyperformance benchmarks <https://gitlab.com/mopsa/benchmarks/pyperformance-benchmarks>`_,

- the analysis a small real-world utility called `Pathpicker <https://gitlab.com/mopsa/benchmarks/pathpicker-analysis>`_.
