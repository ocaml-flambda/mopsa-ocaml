Overview
========

The interactive engine provides a ``gdb``-like interface to Mopsa that allows executing an analysis step-by-step, adding breakpoints and inspecting the inferred invariants.

To start an interactive session, use the option ``-engine interactive``:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../resources/output/interactive-welcome.html

Type ``help`` to display the list of available commands:

.. raw:: html
