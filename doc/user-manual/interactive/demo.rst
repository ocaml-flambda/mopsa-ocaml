Recording a demo
================

Pre-recorded demos of the interactive engine can be recorded using `asciinema <asciinema.org>`_.
`CopyQ <https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ can be used to go through a list of commands, stored in a paste buffer. You just need to enable the "copy next item" feature
You can then adjust playing options to hide idle times.
