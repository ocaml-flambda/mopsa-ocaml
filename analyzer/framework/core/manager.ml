(**                             {2 Managers}                                *)
(*==========================================================================*)


(** Managers provide access to full analyzer.

    ['a] is the type of the toplevel abstract element, and ['t] is the type of
    local abstract element (that is, the type of the domain that calls the
    manager). *)
type ('a, 't) man = {
  lattice : 'a lattice;
  (** Access to lattice operators on the toplevel abstract element ['a]. *)

  (** {3 Accessors to domain's abstract element}

      Each domain can get and set its abstract element in the transfer functions
      with [get] and [set].  *)

  get : token -> 'a flow -> ('a, 't) cases;
  (** Returns the domain's abstract element ['t]. A disjunction of cases is
      returned when partitioning is used. *)

  set : token -> 't -> 'a flow -> 'a post;
  (** Sets the domain's abstract element ['t]. *)

  (** {3 Toplevel Transfer Functions}

      The domains access the top-level lattice transfer function through the
      manager with these functions. It is possible to ask the manager to route
      the transfer functions (e.g. [eval]) to different domains with the
      optional [?route] parameter. If [?route] is not set, the routing starts
      from the root of the domains DAG. *)

  exec : ?route:route -> stmt -> 'a flow -> 'a post;
  (** [man.exec stmt flow] executes [stmt] in [flow] and returns the post state. *)

  eval : ?route:route -> ?translate:semantic -> ?translate_when:(semantic*(expr->bool)) list -> expr -> 'a flow -> 'a eval;
  (** [man.eval expr flow] evaluates [expr] in [flow] and returns the result
      expression.

      There are two kinds of evaluations: within the same semantic
      (simplifications), or to another semantic (translations). Calling
      [man.eval expr flow] performs both kinds of evaluations. The result [e']
      of [man.eval expr flow] is a {i simplification} of [e] within the same
      semantic. To retrieve a translation to another semantic, one can use
      the [?translate] parameter: [man.eval expr flow ~translate:semantic] is a
      {i translation} of the {i simplification} of [e] in [semantic]. A common
      use case is to translate expressions to Universal with
      [man.eval expr flow ~translate:"Universal"]. It is possible to control
      when the translation is applied with [?translate_when]. *)

  ask : 'r. ?route:route -> ('a,'r) query -> 'a flow -> ('a, 'r) cases;
 (** [man.ask query flow] performs a query to other domains. If no domain can
      answer the query, [man.ask query flow] results in a runtime error. *)

  print_expr : ?route:route -> 'a flow -> (printer -> expr -> unit);
  (** [man.print_expr flow] is the expression printer for the type ['a]. *)

  (** {3 Changes Management} *)

  add_change : stmt -> path -> 'a flow -> change_map -> change_map;
  (** Add a statement to the changes map. *)
}
