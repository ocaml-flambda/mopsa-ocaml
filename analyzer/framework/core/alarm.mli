(** Alarms - issues found by the analyzer in a program

    During the analysis, domains can perform checks to verify whether some
    property of interest is preserved. Domains declare the list of checks that
    they are responsible for in their header, and can generate 6 types of
    diagnostics for a given check and regarding a given location range:

    - [Safe] indicates that the property of interest is preserved for all
    execution paths reaching the check location.
    - [Error] represent issues that are proven true alarms for all execution
    paths.
    - [Warning] is used for potential alarms that maybe infeasible in some
    execution paths.
    - [Info] is used for alarms that will not cause program failure (and the analysis can continue)
      but that should be addressed by the user.
    - [Unimplemented] is used to indicate that the analysis stopped at a certain
      point, because it encountered some unimplemented functionality.
    - [Unreachable] indicates that the check location can't be reached in
    any execution path.

(** {1 Alarms} *)
(** ********** *)

(** Alarms are issues related to a check in a given range and a given
    callstack.  Domains can add new kinds of alarms to store information
    related to the issue, such suspect values that raised the alarm.
    Nevertheless, domains can use the generic alarm [A_generic of check] if
    they don't have addition static information to attach to the alarm.
