(** String length abstraction.

    This abstract domain implements the technique presented in [1]. It
    abstracts C strings by the position of the first `\0` character in
    the base memory block. The length is kept in an underlying numeric
    domain. Therefore, the domain is implemented as a stack domain, to
    allow sharing the underlying domain with others.

    The domain is stateless. It abstraction is performed by rewriting
    statements/expressions in C into equivalent ones in Universal using
    the length variable.
