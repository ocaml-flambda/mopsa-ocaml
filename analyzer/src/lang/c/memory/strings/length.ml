(** String length abstraction.

    This abstract domain implements the technique presented in [1]. It
    abstracts C strings by the position of the first `\0` character within the
    base memory block.

    The length is kept in an underlying numeric domain. Therefore, the domain
    is implemented as a stack domain, to allow sharing the underlying domain
    with others.

    The domain is stateless, because abstraction is performed by rewriting
    statements/expressions in C into equivalent ones in Universal over
    the length variable. Not internal state is required.
