This directory extends the Universal language with Control Flow Graphs.
CFG can be used alternatively (or in addition) to AST-style programs.
It can be more convenient than AST for low-level programs, such as
byte-code (JVM, LLVM) or assembly programs.

As Universal, this CFG language is meant to be extended to real-life
languages by providing the required atomic statements (assignments, tests,
etc.).
